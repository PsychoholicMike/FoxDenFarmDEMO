Welcome to my Fox Den Farm home page!  I'm Amy Trudeau.  I've been farming since 2009, and have owned Fox Den Farm since 2012.  I went in to organic agriculture because I wanted to spend my life doing something that would have a positive impact on my community and the world.  Here at Fox Den, I grow a wide variety of healthy, top-quality vegetables, following strict organic farming practices.  I never use glyphosate (Roundup® and similar products) or any other herbicides or pesticides on my crops, and all of my fertilizers and soil amendments are <a href="https://www.omri.org/" target="_blank">OMRI</a> approved.  As often as possible, I source non-GMO certified organic seeds from <a href="http://www.johnnyseeds.com/?source=google_johnny_seeds&source=google_johnny_seeds&gclid=Cj0KEQjwv_fKBRCG8a3ao-OQuZ8BEiQAvpHp6M_F62lPQvT4V_gepNtmYWAUpU_nTDEDqgGLoITloZYaAsRj8P8HAQ
" target=”_blank”> Johnny's Selected Seeds</a> in Maine.  I use organic potting soil from the <a href="http://www.vermontcompost.com" target="_blank">Vermont Compost Company®</a>, and fish-based organic fertilizer from <a href="http://www.neptunesharvest.com" target="_blank">Neptune's Harvest</a> in Massachusettes.
